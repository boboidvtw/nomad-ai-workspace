/**
 * CSS newer than the declared `strict_min_version` fails no build and no unit
 * test — Firefox invalidates the whole rule group, or resolves the custom
 * property to nothing, and the surface loses its styling with no console error.
 * That is the shape of the Safari 15.4 lookbehind trap in
 * `.github/docs/regressions/browser-release.md`, so the floor gets a static
 * contract rather than a comment.
 *
 * The contract: a feature newer than the floor may be used, but only inside an
 * `@supports` guard, so the degradation is deliberate and visible in the diff.
 *
 * Scope is the CSS reaching Firefox through the STATIC content scripts. Plugin
 * catalog stylesheets are excluded on purpose: they only load on sites
 * registered through optional host permissions, which Firefox honors from 128,
 * so they can never render below this floor.
