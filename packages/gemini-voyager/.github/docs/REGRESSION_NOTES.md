# Regression Notes

Use this page to find the regression notes that match a change. Search for the affected feature or
service, then open the matching topic file. Load another topic only when the change crosses that
boundary.

## Add a note

Add a note when the root cause was not obvious, a maintainer could repeat the mistake, and a
regression test or exact verification command now protects the behavior.

Each entry has three fields:

- **Trap:** the symptom and root cause.
- **Rule:** the invariant the implementation must preserve.
- **Guard:** the protecting test or verification command.

Keep each field to one paragraph. Source history already records the fixing commit, so add commit
details only when the introduction point changes how a maintainer should reason about the bug. Run
`bun run regressions:check` after editing these notes.
