# Native primitive

Read this for the selected path; shared constraints and PR evidence remain in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md).

**(c) Primitive.** First-party TypeScript under `src/features/plugins/verbs/`,
called by name from a manifest's `native` op. Pick this only when the behavior
cannot be data: it needs event handling, its own state, or DOM that Voyager
builds. Three files divide it: the contract in `verbs/contracts.ts` (data only),
the implementation in `verbs/<name>.ts`, the binding in `verbs/registry.ts`,
plus an entry appended to `verbs/paramsBaseline.json`.

A primitive is a published API. Plan D9 holds it to: parameters are only ever
**added**, and only as **optional**; a published parameter never changes type
and never becomes required; `sinceEngine` never changes; anything breaking ships
under a **new name**, because `handler` carries no version suffix.
`verbs/contracts.test.ts` enforces this against the committed baseline. A
primitive PR also needs parametric tests over **two sites'** fixtures, so the
behavior is proven to be site-independent rather than one site's code with a
name on it.

A primitive does not stand alone: the plugin that invokes it is still path (a),
and usually lands in the same PR.

## Implementation

1. `verbs/contracts.ts`: append the contract entry (`name`, `sinceEngine`,
   `semantic`, `params`, `description`). `sinceEngine` is the
   `PLUGIN_ENGINE_VERSION` the primitive first ships in, so bump
   `src/features/plugins/constants.ts` in the same PR and use the new value.
2. `verbs/<name>.ts`: the `validateParams` guard (hand-written, no schema
   library, per D17) and `activate(scope, params, context)`. Register every
   side effect on the `PluginScope` so unmount pays it all back, and report the
   element count through `context.setTargetCounter` so the health signal works.
3. `verbs/registry.ts`: bind the implementation. `verifyPrimitiveRegistry()`
   fails when the two lists disagree.
4. `verbs/paramsBaseline.json`: append the entry. Never edit an existing one.
5. Tests: the parametric two-site test, plus the contract test staying green.
6. The manifest that uses it: `requires.handlers: ["<name>"]` and an `engine`
   range whose minimum is at least `sinceEngine`.

```bash
bun run test src/features/plugins
bun run catalog:build
```

Use these focused checks while developing; the final PR verification in `SKILL.md` covers unchanged checks already run.

## Complete when

- **Primitive**: contract, implementation, registry binding and baseline entry
  agree; `contracts.test.ts` and the two-site parametric test pass; the engine
  version and every dependent manifest's `engine` floor were bumped together;
  the first plugin that calls it is verified on a real page; and the parameters
  added are optional, with any breaking change carrying a new name.
