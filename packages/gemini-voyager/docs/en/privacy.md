# Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 7, 2026

## Overview

Voyager is a local-first browser extension for organizing and enhancing supported AI chat workspaces. It processes limited user data only to provide features the user requests. Voyager does not operate a backend that receives conversations, prompts, browsing activity, images, or account identifiers, and it does not use advertising or analytics trackers.

## Data Processed

Depending on which features you use, Voyager may process:

- **Website content and personal communications**: conversation text, prompts, drafts, images, links, and other supported-page content used for folders, navigation, export, prompt management, research, and interface features.
- **Account identifiers**: a supported Google service may expose the signed-in email address. Voyager converts it to a local account identifier so data from different accounts remains separated. Voyager does not send the raw email address to us.
- **Web history and user activity**: supported-site URLs, conversation routes, and limited page, interaction, and network events needed for navigation, shortcuts, usage displays, response-completion notifications, and other requested features. This data is not used for profiling or advertising.
- **Authentication information**: an OAuth2 token with the `drive.file` scope, only when the user explicitly enables Google Drive sync.
- **Extension data and settings**: folders, prompt templates, drafts, starred messages, usage snapshots, plugin state, and interface preferences.

This data is stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` or, for supported settings, in `chrome.storage.sync`. It remains on the user's device or browser-sync account unless the user explicitly uses a transfer described below.

## User-Requested Transfers

- **Google Drive sync (optional)**: selected backup data is transferred directly between the user's device and their own Google Drive. Chrome, Edge, and Firefox use the browser identity API; the direct Safari app uses native Google Sign-In and stores credentials in the macOS Keychain. Both paths request only the limited `drive.file` scope, and OAuth tokens are not sent to a Voyager server.
- **iCloud sync on Safari (optional)**: selected backup data is transferred by the native Safari extension directly to the user's private CloudKit database in their iCloud account. Voyager does not receive the user's Apple ID or an iCloud authentication token, and the developer cannot access records in that private database.
- **Exports and images**: when the user requests an export, Voyager may fetch images from their existing page-hosted sources and may request temporary access needed to capture generated interface content. The resulting file is created for the user; it is not uploaded to a Voyager server.
- **Public project resources**: Voyager may request public release, announcement, or documentation resources. These requests do not include conversation or prompt content.
- **Plugin catalog updates**: on a site where the user has enabled at least one plugin, Voyager may fetch an updated catalog file for that site over HTTPS from `https://voyager.nagi.fun/catalog/hosts/<site host>.json`, for example `https://voyager.nagi.fun/catalog/hosts/chat.deepseek.com.json`. The check runs when such a page is opened, or when the extension popup is opened on it, and only if the last check is older than the interval the user chose (6 hours by default; 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, or manual only). Gemini and AI Studio pages have no plugins and never trigger a request. The request is a plain GET that carries no cookies, no account or extension identifier, and no page or conversation content; as with any web request, the server sees the requesting IP address and browser user agent, plus the site host name in the URL path. On plugin sites the popup provides a "Plugin online updates" switch and the check interval selector, both stored in browser sync storage and included in settings backup. With the switch off, Voyager does not contact voyager.nagi.fun unless the user presses "Check for plugin updates now". If the request fails or the site has no catalog file, the plugin snapshot bundled with the extension stays in use. A fetched catalog contains only CSS and JSON, which are validated and sanitized before use; no JavaScript is downloaded or executed. This check is separate from the announcement check, which has its own setting. voyager.nagi.fun is static hosting behind a Cloudflare proxy; the Voyager project does not log or retain these requests, and connection metadata (IP address, User-Agent) is handled by the hosting providers under their own privacy policies.

Voyager does not sell user data or transfer it for advertising, creditworthiness, or purposes unrelated to the extension's user-facing features.

## Permissions

- **Storage**: saves extension data and preferences locally and, where supported, through browser sync.
- **Identity**: authenticates optional Google Drive sync after explicit user action. Safari iCloud sync uses the Mac's system iCloud account instead of this browser permission.
- **Scripting**: injects only extension-bundled scripts on supported sites; no remote JavaScript or WebAssembly is executed.
- **Active tab and declarative content**: identifies the supported site opened by the user and displays the appropriate site-specific controls.
- **Notifications and alarms**: provides opt-in response-completion notifications and periodic checks for public compatibility announcements.
- **Host permissions**: enables Voyager features on Gemini, AI Studio, Claude, and ChatGPT and supports user-requested Google Drive and image operations.
- **Optional host permissions**: requests only the origins a user explicitly enables for custom sites or plugins. `<all_urls>` may also be requested temporarily when the user chooses an export that captures generated interface content; if denied, export continues without that capture.

## Retention and User Control

Local and browser-sync data remains until the user deletes it, clears extension storage, or uninstalls the extension. Cloud backups remain in the user's selected Google Drive or iCloud account until the user removes them from that account. Users can disable optional features and revoke optional site access or Google authorization through Voyager and browser settings.

## Google API Limited Use

Voyager's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as Voyager changes. The latest version and its update date will be published on this page.
