/**
 * Lifecycle contract for Gemini / AI Studio native content modules.
 *
 * Two lifetimes are standardised here and nothing else:
 *
 * - **page teardown** — `start` hands back one `stop` that removes every
 *   listener, observer, timer, storage subscription and injected node the
 *   feature owns. `cleanupManager` runs it on unload at `position`.
 * - **popup toggle** — a feature with `toggle` is mounted and stopped while
 *   the page lives, without a reload, by `createNativeFeatureToggle`.
 *
 * Sidebar remounts and account changes are *not* covered: those lifetimes
 * differ per feature (see the folders/timeline regression notes) and stay
 * inside each module.
 *
 * `src/pages/content/__tests__/nativeFeatureLifecycle.test.ts` enforces the
 * contract for every entry of `NATIVE_FEATURE_LIST`.
